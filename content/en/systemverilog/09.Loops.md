# Loops
A Loop is nothing but statements that need to be run more than once are included in the loop instead of writing the statements repeatedly. Loops will run multiple times based on conditional statements, If the condition is always true then it becomes an infinite loop and the system will hang.

### 1. while
In a while loop, first we need to check the condition then only we can execute the statements. We need to initialize the variable in the condition before execution.  
A while loop first checks the condition is true and then executes the statements if it is true. If the condition is false, the loop ends right there.     
   
**Syntax** -
```systemverilog   
while(condition)begin
 Statements;
end
```

**Example** - 

Here, the example shows the print of a statement of 5 times using the while loop.  


**Code snap**  
```systemverilog
    int apple = 1; //int data type and variable name is apple

    initial begin  //procedural blocks
     $display("-----while loop output ---");
     while (apple <6) //while loop and condition
      begin
       $display("\t value of apple = %0d", apple);
       apple++;
      end  
    end
```
**Output snap**  

The below figure shows the output of the while loop

**Declare variable inside the loop**
  
We can declare variables inside the loop. But that variable is a local variable, only we can use it inside the loop but can't use it out of the loop. If we use the variable out of the loop it will through an error.  
  
**Example** - 

The below example show the difference between the local and global variable.  There are two variables are there one is local (a) and another one is global(x). a is the local variable for a first while loop. We can not use it outside that particular loop in which it is declared. x is a global variable, we can use it out of the loop.  

**Code Snap**  
```systemverilog   
    int x = 2; // variable declare  
    initial begin  
    while ( x<5)begin  
    int a;  // declare the variable inside the loop  
    $display ("Iteration = %0d",x);  
    $display ("a is a local variable");  
    $display ("The size of a = %0d",$size(a));  
    $display ("------------------------------");  
    // a is a local variable. We can't use it out of the loop.  
    x++;    // incrementing the x  
    end  
    // After the execution of the above loop. The value of x = 4 .  

    while (x<8)begin  
     $display ("x is a global varaible ");  
     $display ( "The value of x = %0d",x);  
     $display ("------------------------");  
    x++;  
    end  
    end  
```
**Output Snap**  

The below figure shows the output of the  declaring the  variable inside the loop

 ### 2. do-while 
In the do-while loop, first execute the condition once and then check whether the condition is true or not. If the condition is true, the set of statements is executed until the condition turns out to be false. If the condition is false the loop ends right there.  

**Syntax** -  
```systemverilog
do begin 
 Statements; 
end
while(condition)begin 
 Statements;
end   
```

**Example** - 

The below example shows code to understand the working of do - while loop.  



**Code Snap**   
```systemverilog
     int apple = 1; //int data type and variable name is apple
     initial begin //procedural block
     $display("------do while output ---");
     do //do statements
    begin
     $display("\t Value of apple = %0d", apple);

     apple = apple +1;
    end      
    while(apple<6); //while loop condition    
    end     
```

### 3.repeat 

This loop is used for repeating statements or operations for a fixed given number of times.  

**Syntax** -  
```systemverilog
repeat(no. of times)begin  
 statements;
end  
```  
**Example** - 

The below example shows the working of the repeat loop. Here, there are three statements inside the repeat loop. the repeating is for 4 times.  
 
**Code Snap**  
```systemverilog  
    module repeat_code;  
    initial begin ;  
     repeat(4)begin   // Repeat the statements inside 4 times  
       $display ("Good morning");  
       $display ("Keep shining");  
       $display ("--------------");  
     end  
    end  
```
**Flowchart:**

**Output Snippet**  

The below figure shows the output of the repeat loop

**Implementation of repeat loop using for loop**  
We can implement a repeat loop using other loops also. Below example will show the implementation of a repeat loop using for loop.  

**Example** - 

Same as the above example, here we are repeating these same statements using them for a  loop.  
  
**Code Snippet**  
```systemverilog
     initial begin  
      for (int i = 1;i<=4;i++)begin   // for loop initialization, repeat the statements inside it for  
         $display ("Good morning");   // 4 times (i =1,2,3,4)  
         $display ("Keep Shining");  
         $display ("------------");  
       end  
    end  
```
**Output Snap**  

The below figure shows the output of the repeat loop by using for loop


<img width="435" alt="15" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110443268/188803668-ac46bcff-47a4-4867-8f87-3b946770c3e8.png">

## 4.for loop  

For loop is simply a more compact form of while loop. In for loop assignment, there are three parts:  
* Initialization - initialize the required variables for running the loop.
* condition  - based on this condition the number of repetitions of for loop is dependent.
* modifier - incrementing/decrementing the variables.

**Syntax:**
```systemverilog
for ( Initialization; condition; modifier ) 
begin
statement1;
statement2 
.   
.  
statementN;
end    
```
**Example:**  
```systemverilog  
          for (int i=1;i<=5;i++)    
          begin     
          $display(" Iteration %0d ",i);     
          end   
          $display(" out of loop ");  
```
 In the above example, i is the variable initialized and declared as 1, here i is the local scope only means we can't use i out of for loop. In condition i should be less than or equal to 5 means for loop statements will be executed if the value of i is matched with condition or else comes out of the loop and the last part is the modifier which is incrementing i value by 1.  

**Flowchart:**  

![forloop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110412468/188261911-62cacd1a-ee35-427a-8247-27f25a6fef28.png)  

                             Flowchart.4- for loop flowchart  

**output:**  
![for1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110412468/188284411-8bbf4704-d0a5-4f19-8ad3-9dc068d30d31.png)  

As per the flowchart initially, i is 1 so the condition satisfies and performs display statement and prints as "iteration 1" and then goes to modifier and increments i, check the condition again and so on till i=5, now after 5 i is incremented to 6 then checks condition which is failed so comes out of the loop.

Note: If you use a local scope variable outside then the compiler throughs an error as shown below.

![for error1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110412468/188284390-190b7e96-887b-4234-9aaa-56303b6afc80.png)


***
**Nested for loop**

**Syntax:**
```systemverilog 
for ( Initialization ; condition; modifier ) 
 begin
  statements;
   for ( Initialization ; condition ; modifier )
    begin
     statements;
   end  
 end 
```
**Example:**   
```systemverilog
          for (int i=1;i<=2;i++)   
          begin   
          $display("\n\t%0d Table:\n",i);   
          for(int j=1,k=0;j<=10;j++)    
          begin   
          k=i*j;   
          $display("\t %0d X %0d = %0d",i,j,k);   
          end   
          end   
```
In the above example we are using nested for loop to print tables, so took i as table number and j for going from 1-10 and k to store the value of multiplication. Here observe that j & k are used at the same initialization and you can do the same for conditions and modifiers also to have multi variables at a time.

**output:**  
![table loop1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110412468/188284380-5c87ad4b-8990-4abd-bea0-177beefece59.png)    

In this i,j& k are used as i X j = k, so i is range from 1-2 and each has j from 1-10 and k is storing and printing using display statements.    

**Advantages:**
* Readable
* syntax will be easier(can mention all initialization,condition, modifier in a single place)  

**limitations:**  
* variables initialized are only local.  

***
## 5.foreach 

This loop is an upgraded version of for loop for traversing through each element of an array. This iterates through index 0 till the size of an array mentioned.

foreach is a shorter version of the following for loop  
```systemverilog
for(int i=0;i<$size(array);i++)
```

**Syntax:**
```systemverilog  
foreach(array[i])  
begin  
statement1;
statement2  
.`  
.  
statementN;
end   
```
**Example:**  
```systemverilog
          int array[5]   
          foreach(array[i])     
          begin      
          array[i]=i;    
          $display("\tarray[%0d]=%0d",i,array[i]);     
          end     
          $display(" out of loop ");   
```
In the above example, a fixed array of size 5 is taken, using a foreach loop to traverse through each element, and executes the statements of the foreach loop from array[0] to array[4].  
  

**Flowchart:**  

![foreach flowchart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110412468/188263683-d16a12a4-b6a5-4dc5-aa13-20cade36fd31.PNG)  

               Flowchart-5.foreach loop flowchart  

**output:**  
![foreach1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110412468/188284453-97501f0b-3bd3-4231-bc70-2bb179409464.png)   

As per the flowchart initially checks for the size of the array, as it is >0, so proceeds to execution of foreach statements i.e., assigns array[0]=0 and displaying the same and then increments i value by 1 and repeats the same until array[4]. Then at array[5] condition is failing because the array size is 5 only (i.e., 0,1,2,3,4) comes out of loop.

The same functionality of above program we can achieve by using for loop as following line replaced with foreach.  

```systemverilog
for(int i=0;i<$size(array);i++)
```  

The following is the snap of output of foreach using for loop
**output of foreach using for loop:**

**Note:** we can use nested foreach similarly as used in nested for loop and can access multidimensional arrays.  

**Advantages:**  
* syntax is easier.
* Readable  

**limitations:**  

* It is only used for arrays  
* Modifier is not accessible(if we want to store array only in even positions then foreach not good option) 
* Cannot traverse through array in reverse fashion

## 6.forever  

The forever loop name itself says that it will run forever i.e., throughout the simulation or forcefully shut down the forever loop.  
It is similar to the always procedural block in System Verilog but generally, it's not possible to use always in classes to achieve that concept we can make use of this forever loop.  
If we use a forever loop without force stop the compiler will hang.
There are two ways to stop forever, they are   
* $finish;
* break;

* ### forever with $finish:
forever loop doesn't have any conditions as the number of times to repeat the loop is infinite so no condition is needed.
**Syntax:**
```systemverilog  
forever
begin  
statement1;  
statement2
.  
.  
statementN;  
end  
```
**Example:**  
```systemverilog           
          forever   
          begin    
          $display("\t @ %0d ns Iteration %0d",$time,a);   
          a++;   
          #4;   
          end   
          initial begin   
          #20 $display("\n\t@ %0d ns Stopped using $finish",$time);   
          $finish;   
          end   
```
In the above example, forever is used which is having display statement and increment a and a 4ns delay for every repetition like that it will run forever but in another initial block there is $finish which will stop the simulation so this stops the forever also.


**Flowchart:**  
  
![forever finish](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110412468/188265756-3184f9c5-fc3e-4597-b10b-b096416f339a.png)  

               Flowchart-6.forever with finish flowchart  

**output:**   
![forever using finish1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110412468/188284468-0ab76b2c-abde-49f4-84dc-5c603adfcf3d.PNG)  

As the forever doesn't have any condition it simply enters and displays a value and then a is incremented and a 4ns delay is introduced so for every 4ns the output is getting printed and at 20 ns $display and prints stopped using $finish is executed in second initial module as well as $finish is called in which will terminate the simulation.

* ### forever with break:  

**Syntax:**
```systemverilog
forever 
begin 
statement1; 
statement2 
.
.
statementN;
end   
```
**Example:**  
```systemverilog
          forever   
          begin   
          $display("\t @ %0d ns Iteration %0d",$time,a);   
          a++;   
          #4;   
          if(a>8)   
          break;   
          end   
          $display("\n\t@ %0d ns Stopped using break",$time);    
          end   
``` 
This is similar example of forever with $finish but here we have used break condition instead of $finish based on a value greater than 8.


**Flowchart:**  
  
![forever break](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110412468/188266175-5b081e46-62ac-4be8-8dd6-9bbf11e397d5.png)

As the forever doesn't have any condition it simply enters and displays a value and then a is incremented and a 4ns delay is introduced so for every 4ns the output is getting printed after a value greater than 8 then enters into if block which has a break which moves simulator to out of the loop.

**advantages:**  
* we cant use always block inside an always or a class there this forever is used and can achieve the same job  

**limitations:**  
* If we don't quit the forever then the simulator will hang.
