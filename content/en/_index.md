### About this site

This is a website for ASIC front-end formal verification. My interests mainly focus on digital designs and how to validate them.


The original intention of the website is to record and share skills, experiences, and tutorial content in personal work and hobbies. It is hoped that through recording and accumulation in the form of blog posts, it can help myself and netizens encounter similar problems in the future for reference.
